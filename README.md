1. Use a simple Classification Tree with predictors: age/fair (replace missing values with mean), normalize, predict.  
2. Use Classification Tree with Pruning, Use cross validation to tune parameters: 
3. Use Classification Tree with Bagging, Test with Age/Fare, then expand to 12 predictors 
4. Classification Tree with Boosting 
5. Random Forest Classification Tree

Each folder name is self explanatory, includes csv files. Make sure to add to matlab path or place csv file in the same directory as matlab module.
